# Final Graduation Project 
## Low latency bilateral communication between server and client in a Web environment


In this project, I explored the possibilities of a low latency bilateral communication between server and client in a Web environment. The client, running on Android, gets data from the device's sensors and send it to the server. Then, the server apply this data to a simple visualization page.
